Google buys thermostat maker Nest for [$3.2 billion](http://investor.google.com/releases/2014/0113.html) in cash.

In a Q&A section of the [announcement post](https://nest.com/blog/2014/01/13/nest-google-and-you/) on Nest's company blog, the new member of the Google family tries to play down the privacy concerns of it's users that fear, that Google will know a lot of additional things about them in the near future (emphasis mine):

> Will Nest customer data be shared with Google?</br>
Our privacy policy clearly limits the use of customer information to providing and improving Nest’s products and **services**. We’ve always taken privacy seriously and this will not change.

So far, so good. But what would be, if the **services** integrate a Google product? Nest has an answer to that also:

> Will Nest and Google products work with each other?</br>
Nest’s product line obviously caught the attention of Google and I’m betting that there’s a lot of cool stuff we could do together, but nothing to share today.

In plain text: Yes, we will integrate with Google services and yes, then your data will be a part of the galactic Google database.

Remember: Google is an advertising company and makes a living from knowing as much as possible about you. So, dear Nest user, be prepared to get some advices from AdSense regarding your room temperature, or some hints about a better timing for [your drive to work](http://support.nest.com/article/What-is-Auto-Away).
